## Executive Summary

## Project Context

**Project Name:** Chorus
**Project Type:** Software - AI-Enhanced Social Chat Platform
**Track:** BMad Method - Greenfield
**Project Level:** Level 3-4 (Full Planning Suite)
**Field Type:** Greenfield (New Project)
**Current Phase:** Phase 2 (Solutioning) → Transitioning to Phase 3 (Implementation)

**Workflow Status Check:**
- ✅ Phase 0 (Discovery): Complete
  - Brainstorming session completed
  - Product brief finalized
- ✅ Phase 1 (Planning): Complete
  - PRD created and validated
  - UX design: Conditional (not required for MVP)
- ✅ Phase 2 (Solutioning): Architecture complete, awaiting gate check
  - Architecture document created
  - Architecture validation: Optional (not performed)
  - **Current:** Solutioning gate check (required) ← **WE ARE HERE**
- ⏳ Phase 3 (Implementation): Not started
  - Next workflow: Sprint planning

**Assessment Scope:**
Based on Level 3-4 project requirements, this assessment validates:
1. **PRD Completeness** - Requirements, success criteria, scope boundaries
2. **Architecture Coverage** - System design, technology stack, implementation patterns
3. **PRD ↔ Architecture Alignment** - Requirements supported by architecture
4. **Epic/Story Coverage** - Implementation plan for all requirements (if epics exist)
5. **Greenfield Readiness** - Project initialization, infrastructure setup
6. **Sequencing Validation** - Dependencies and logical ordering

**Expected Artifacts for Level 3-4 Greenfield:**
- ✅ Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- ✅ Architecture Document (separate from PRD)
- ⚠️ Epic and Story Breakdown (to be validated)
- ❓ UX Design Specification (conditional - may not exist)
- ✅ Workflow status tracking

**Validation Approach:**
This gate check will systematically verify that planning and solutioning phases are cohesive, complete, and ready for implementation. Any critical gaps, contradictions, or missing elements will be flagged for resolution before sprint planning begins.
